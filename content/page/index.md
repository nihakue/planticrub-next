# PLANTICRUB _plan·ti·crub_

> Noun.  A planticrub was a type of small dry-stoned walled garden/enclosure, designed as a nursery area for kale seedlings in the Shetland Islands. Also crub or, in Unst, crö or plantiecrö.

I'm a garden planting designer and gardener based in Edinburgh, United Kingdom.

I specialise in planting design, designing and planting new borders and renovating existing borders, transforming your garden through plants not hard landscaping.

I have a BA(Hons) in Intermedia Fine Art from Edinburgh College of Art. I completed the RHS's certificate in the principles of horticulture (level 2) in 2011/2012 at The Royal Botanic Gardens Edinburgh and the RBGE certificate in practical horticulture at Benmore Botanic Gardens in 2012. I did an internship in the Rock Garden at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew in 2013 before setting up Planticrub Garden Design in the spring of 2013.
In 2015 I exhibited a containerised plant display at Gardening Scotland, winning a bronze medal.

I believe in the power of gardens, to have your own living oasis, a haven for wildlife and people alike. I love designing for year round interest, seeing life and colour in the garden on a dreich winter’s day lifts my mood like nothing else.
