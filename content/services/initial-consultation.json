  "description": "An initial consultation about your garden is free and is simply a chance to meet and have a chat about your garden, what you'd like from it and what types of planting you love. I will take the opportunity to measure the sections of your garden you are interested to work on and to photograph and take notes. This visit normally lasts about an hour.",
